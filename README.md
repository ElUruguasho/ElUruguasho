Hello fellow developer, hope you find my public repos interesting!

The repos here show my journey on this incredible world of software development and my attempts at learning PySpark and Go.

I wish I dedicated more time to these and built more interesting projects. A way I found to push myself forward is building in public repos for everyone, with enough time to do it, to laugh at it 😁
